Build a DeFi lending protocol in Aleo that solves the critical record ownership vs liquidation access structural issue.
CRITICAL CONSTRAINT TO ADDRESS: In Aleo, only record owners can use their records as transition inputs, but we need third parties to liquidate undercollateralized positions. The current structure creates an impossible situation where:

Loan owners cannot liquidate (blocked by access control)
Third parties cannot liquidate (they don't own the loan records)
Result: No liquidations possible

REQUIREMENTS:

Redesign the architecture so third parties can liquidate without owning loan records
Consider using public mappings to store liquidatable loan data instead of private records
Maintain privacy for borrowers while enabling public liquidation mechanisms
Ensure only external parties can liquidate (no self-liquidation)
Keep core DeFi features: deposit, borrow, repay, withdraw, interest calculation
Include proper collateralization ratios and liquidation incentives

SUGGESTED APPROACH: Use hybrid architecture with private records for user ownership and public mappings for liquidation data visibility, or implement a loan registry system accessible to liquidators.
FOCUS: Solve the structural contradiction while maintaining security and privacy principles
